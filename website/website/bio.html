		<p id="bio"> I was born and raised in Lakewood, California, and I am currently a junior at CSUMB.  I am working on earning my Bachelor’s Degree in Communication Design, with a concentration in visual design while I am here.  At the moment, my goal is to end up having a career in web development, but I am still deciding exactly where I’d like to go with it as I learn and gain more experience in this field.  When I’m not in school, I love going on roadtrips, spending time with my friends and family, and watching movies. </p>
